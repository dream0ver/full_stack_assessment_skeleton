To build and launch the frontend, backend, and database applications, run the following command from the root directory:

docker-compose -f docker-compose.final.yml up --build -d 

Wait for about one minute for the services to fully start. 
Once you see the log "Data Source has been initialized, Ready to accept request" in the logs, the setup is complete. 
You can then access the running application at localhost:3000.


Use below command to shutdown and remove volume of the running containers

docker-compose -f docker-compose.final.yml down -v
